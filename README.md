# QR-Code-Generator
A two-dimensional barcode that smartphones can read is called a QR code. More than 4,000 characters can be encoded in a small format with it. QR codes can be used to deliver messages, open URLs, show text to users, and store contact details in address books, among other things.
Here, the only pre-installed part of our application that has all of the logic is App.js. To retrieve the necessary QR code image, we will use the "create-qr-code" free opensource API (no auth required). A button to download the QR code image will also be available.
